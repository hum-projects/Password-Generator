# Password-Generator
Password generator created in python by me using tkinter.

I first had to 'import tkinter' and 'import * from tkinter' because there are somethings that don't work with just one import.
Then I also had to 'import random' because i was going to use it to randomly muddle up letters for the password.
The next thing i had to do was create the tkinter window, give it a title and size.
And lastly i had to create checkboxes.

For the function 'password_generate(leng)', i had to create three variables.
uppercase_letters, lowercase_letters and numbers.
